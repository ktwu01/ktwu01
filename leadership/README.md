## About Me

I am Koutian Wu, an undergraduate alumnus of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

During my undergraduate years, I actively engaged in student affairs and organizational work, gradually developing key competencies such as project coordination, cross-department collaboration, team communication, and public presentation.

This page presents a summary of my leadership development experiences, including both the roles I assumed in student organizations and records of actual project implementation.

My major leadership highlights include:

- Founding President of USTC Student Xing Yun Poetry Club (grew membership from 0 to 1000+ during term) [Link](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1eiKsI-LtHZQVlkXHX5-VA#%23:~:text=%E5%90%B4%E5%8F%A9%E5%A4%A9) (2020–2022)
